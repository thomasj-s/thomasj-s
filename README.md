### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas, and I love the insights that data can provide.

I am a graduate of Lambda School's data science program with particular interest in statistics, api construction, and predictive modeling.  My personal repository contains a few projects I have completed for personal interests such as baseball and api building.

I am currently looking for entry level employment while continuing to learn and build in the meantime.





Feel free to contact me either here, on linkdin @https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasj-s/

### Hi there 👋

My name is Thomas, and I love the insights that data can provide.

I am a graduate of Lambda School's data science program with particular interest in statistics, api construction, and predictive modeling.  My personal repository contains a few projects I have completed for personal interests such as baseball and api building.

I am currently looking for entry level employment while continuing to learn and build in the meantime.





Feel free to contact me here, on linkdin @ , and facebook @
